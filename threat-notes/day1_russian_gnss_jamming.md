## Analysis

**Threat Actor**  
 Russian state / military electronic warfare units

**Capability**  
 GNSS jamming & spoofing using terrestrial high-power transmitters

**Why This Works (System-Level)**

* GNSS signals are low-power and unauthenticated  
* Line-of-sight from space makes them vulnerable to ground-based interference  
* Civil aviation and maritime systems often lack robust anti-jam fallback

**Primary Targets**

* Military UAV navigation  
* Civil aviation routing systems  
* Maritime navigation in contested regions

**Strategic Impact**

* Degrades situational awareness without kinetic escalation  
* Creates persistent uncertainty rather than one-time disruption  
* Affects both military and civilian systems → political pressure

**Early Indicators / Telemetry (to think about later)**

* Sudden GNSS signal loss or degradation  
* Abnormal SNR patterns  
* Inconsistent position estimates across receivers

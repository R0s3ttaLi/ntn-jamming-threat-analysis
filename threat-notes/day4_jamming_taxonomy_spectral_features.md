## Jamming Types and Spectral Features

* **Constant Jamming**: Attacker broadcasts a powerful signal all the time, occupying the channel by injecting high power interference.  
  * Spectrum: A significant amount of energy is present within a segment of the bandwidth.  
  * Features: Spectral flatness is higher and SNR decreases rapidly in that interval.  
* **Reactive Jamming (channel-aware jamming)**: Attacker activates a jamming attack when it detects traffic in a channel. Energy-efficient, requires tight timing constraints.  
  * Spectrum: The channel is normal pre-transmission, but significant noise appears after transmission starts.  
  * Features: Noise level varies drastically before and during transmission.  
* **Frequency Sweeping (Barrage) Jamming**: Attacks a large number of channels simultaneously.  
  * Spectrum: The channel is typically normal, but significant noise emerges over time. Energy peak periodically shifts across frequencies.  
  * Spectrum: Features: time–frequency correlation, periodic sweeping  
* **Pulse Jamming:** Attacks a small number of channels simultaneously.  
  * Spectrum: One or a few spikes.  
  * Features: High peak-to-average ratio.  
* **Deceptive Jamming (Spoofing):** Covers legitimate signals with a meaningful false signal.  
  * Spectrum: Looks normal.  
  * Features: The phenomenon is not noise-related.

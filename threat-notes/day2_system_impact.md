## Which systems are first affected?

Systems that heavily rely on GPS signals to get positioning data. Unlike phones and vehicles, which often use internal inertial sensors and other signals (e.g. LTE signals from ground base stations) to calibrate its location, ships, planes, and drones rely heavily on GPS signals to get navigation information.

***Priority impact order:***

1. *Commercial aviation (safety-critical, low tolerance)*  
2. *Maritime navigation (wide-area impact, slower detection)*  
3. *UAV operations (mission degradation, military spillover)*

**What effects are immediately visible?**

The jamming attacks made several airports in countries near the Baltic Sea inoperable. e.g. the Tartu airport in Estonia. The jamming has affected not just Estonia, but parts of neighboring Latvia and Lithuania, sites in Finland and Sweden across the Baltic Sea, and as far afield as Poland and Germany, according to publicly reported data from commercial aircraft.

***From an enterprise perspective:***

*increased flight delays, rerouting costs, and elevated insurance and liability risks.*

**What effects are more long term but critical?**

Political:

In the Air and Space Force Magazine article, there is ongoing debate of whether this kind of jamming affecting non-combat nations is an act of “hybrid warfare”, although such GPS jamming affecting civilian activities is legal under the Geneva Convention. 

Operational:

Fallback navigational techniques are used by commercial aircraft. However, the alternatives to GPS lack its accuracy and convenience, and such jamming poses significant challenges to aviation safety.

***Key long-term risk:***

*normalization of GNSS disruption as a non-kinetic pressure tool, eroding trust in civilian navigation infrastructure.*

# NTN Jamming Threat Intelligence & Detection Notes

This repository documents an ongoing exploration of
jamming and interference threats across Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN),
with a focus on threat taxonomy, spectral characteristics,
and detection-oriented reasoning.

## Scope
- GNSS / LEO satellite communications
- Cross-system jamming behaviors (NTN + TN)
- Detection cues from a system and threat perspective

## Contents
- Threat taxonomy and spectral patterns
- Detection considerations and limitations
- Notes on deceptive and hard-to-detect jamming

> This is a work in progress and reflects an evolving understanding.

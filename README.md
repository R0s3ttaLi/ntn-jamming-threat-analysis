# NTN Jamming Threat Intelligence & Detection Notes

This repository documents an ongoing exploration of
jamming and interference threats across Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN),
with a focus on threat taxonomy, spectral characteristics,
and detection-oriented reasoning.

## Scope
- GNSS / LEO satellite communications
- Cross-system jamming behaviors (NTN + TN)
- Detection cues from a system and threat perspective

## Contents
- Threat taxonomy and spectral patterns
- Detection considerations and limitations
- Notes on deceptive and hard-to-detect jamming

## Analytic Hypotheses
Analytic Hypothesis – Hybrid Warfare Indicators

Open-source reporting suggests that Russian GNSS jamming sources are geographically distributed beyond the Russian mainland, including deployments in the Baltic Sea exclave (Kaliningrad), which is geographically distant from Ukraine and significantly closer to NATO member states.

This spatial distribution, particularly observed since approximately September 2024, challenges the official Russian narrative that the jamming activity is solely a defensive response against Ukrainian UAV operations.

Instead, the observed pattern is consistent with hybrid warfare tactics, where non-kinetic, deniable actions are employed to exert pressure across military and civilian domains, including civil aviation and maritime navigation in non-combatant states.

While definitive attribution requires classified intelligence, the geographic scope and cross-border impact of the interference suggest strategic signaling and coercive intent beyond immediate battlefield defense.
